# BuildBuddy - Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
BuildBuddy is a comprehensive project management platform built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. This guide covers deployment and production maintenance.

## System Requirements

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm/yarn/bun package manager
- Git for version control

### Production Environment
- Modern web browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- HTTPS-enabled domain
- CDN for static asset delivery (recommended)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create production environment variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional: Analytics and monitoring
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### 2. Build Process

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run production build
npm run build

# Preview build locally (optional)
npm run preview
```

### 3. Database Setup

Ensure all Supabase migrations are applied:

1. Review migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Apply migrations via Supabase Dashboard or CLI
3. Configure Row Level Security policies
4. Set up Edge Functions for user management

### 4. Deploy to Hosting Platform

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npx vercel
```

#### Option B: Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
```

#### Option C: Custom Server
```bash
npm run build
# Serve dist/ folder with nginx/apache
```

## Production Configuration

### 1. Supabase Settings

#### Authentication
- Configure allowed domains in Auth settings
- Set up proper redirect URLs
- Enable/disable auth providers as needed

#### Security
- Review RLS policies for all tables
- Audit user permissions and roles
- Enable audit logging for sensitive operations

#### Performance
- Configure connection pooling
- Set up database indexes for queries
- Enable caching where appropriate

### 2. Domain and SSL

#### Custom Domain Setup
1. Configure DNS records
2. Set up SSL certificates
3. Update Supabase site URL settings
4. Test authentication flows

#### CDN Configuration
- Enable static asset caching
- Configure cache headers
- Set up image optimization

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:

```typescript
// Performance tracking is automatically enabled
// Check browser dev tools for Core Web Vitals
```

### 2. Error Tracking

Production error tracking is built-in:

```typescript
// Errors are automatically logged to console
// Consider integrating with Sentry or similar service
```

### 3. Analytics

System analytics are available in the admin dashboard:
- User activity metrics
- Project completion rates
- Task performance data
- Security audit logs

### 4. Database Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

```sql
-- Analyze query performance
ANALYZE;

-- Clean up old audit logs (monthly)
DELETE FROM security_audit_log 
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Monitor database size
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) 
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment Security Audit

- [ ] All RLS policies are properly configured
- [ ] Admin users cannot be created by non-admins
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed in API responses
- [ ] Edge functions have proper authorization checks
- [ ] File uploads are restricted and validated
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled for API endpoints

### Production Security

- [ ] Regular security audits via admin dashboard
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Review user permissions quarterly
- [ ] Keep Supabase and dependencies updated
- [ ] Backup database regularly

## Backup and Recovery

### 1. Database Backups

Supabase provides automated backups, but for additional security:

```bash
# Manual backup via Supabase CLI
supabase db dump --local > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### 2. Application Backups

- Source code: Git repository with tags for releases
- Configuration: Environment variables documented
- Assets: Static files backed up separately

### 3. Recovery Procedures

1. **Database Recovery**: Restore from Supabase backup
2. **Application Recovery**: Redeploy from Git repository
3. **Configuration Recovery**: Restore environment variables

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Frontend Optimization

- Code splitting is implemented for route-based lazy loading
- Image optimization with WebP support
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization

### 2. Database Optimization

- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Connection pooling configuration
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations

### 3. Caching Strategy

- Browser caching for static assets
- API response caching where appropriate
- CDN caching for global performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Check Supabase site URL configuration
   - Verify redirect URLs are whitelisted
   - Ensure proper CORS settings

2. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - Review RLS policies
   - Check user role assignments
   - Verify function permissions

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Check for N+1 query problems
   - Review network request waterfall

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production debugging
VITE_DEBUG=true npm run build
```

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily**: Monitor error logs and performance
- **Weekly**: Review security audit logs
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and review access
- **Quarterly**: Full security audit and performance review

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Service Outage**: Check Supabase status and hosting provider
2. **Security Breach**: Immediately revoke compromised credentials
3. **Data Loss**: Restore from latest backup
4. **Performance Degradation**: Scale resources and optimize queries

## Version Control and Releases

### Release Process

1. Create feature branch
2. Implement and test changes
3. Update documentation
4. Create pull request
5. Code review and approval
6. Merge to main branch
7. Tag release version
8. Deploy to production
9. Monitor deployment

### Rollback Procedures

If issues arise post-deployment:

1. Identify the issue
2. Revert to previous Git tag
3. Redeploy previous version
4. Investigate and fix in development
5. Plan next deployment
